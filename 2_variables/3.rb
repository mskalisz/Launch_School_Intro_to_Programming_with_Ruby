=begin
Add another section onto name.rb that prints
the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without 
explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. 
Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.
=end

puts 'Type in your name:'
name = gets.chomp
10.times {puts name}
puts "Hi there, " + name + "!"

#LS solution
10.times do
  puts name
end
